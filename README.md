### How did you get here?

Well, anyways, this is *my* place and I hope to grow, create, and bring joy to myself and others.

### A Little Bit About Me

I'm a college student who finds beauty in life’s little details.  
I love learning languages, traveling, and meeting people from faraway places.  
I believe that people are never kinder than when you speak their native language — it opens doors to empathy and connection.

I'm also a programmer, hoping to create things that shift how others see the world.  
While I value my anonymity and try to protect it, I know that sometimes holding back can make it harder to connect or grow.

I believe the phrase **“life is not fair”** is something everyone should come to understand.  
But I like to add: *“...but that doesn’t mean we can’t try to make it better.”*

Now you know a little more about me — and maybe my anonymity is just a bit more out the window.

I aim to make some pretty things and some useful things.

Feel free to check out what I’m working on!  
You might have to wait for me to post it publicly...
